                Direct Discourse Lab

            In 2020 I began assembling a database of direct discourse in novels. I've gained many skills by doing this, but primarily <strong>project organization and coordination</strong>; this was my "baby" project, which was overseen from start to present by me. The database can be found in a .dump file <a href="https://github.com/las2hs/DDD">here</a>. Based on this database, in 2022 I launched the Direct Discourse Lab, a collaboration with several undergraduate students at UVA. The project's large-scale goal is developing scholarly research out of the database's contents, which divides direct-discourse quotes into conversations and marks them on several aspects (e.g. verb marker, adverb marker, speaker). Currently we are working on a paper about conversations in Jane Austen's novels.
