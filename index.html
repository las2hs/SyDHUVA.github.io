        <p> I was a PhD student in the Department of English, focusing on Native and Indigenous American literatures from the long nineteenth century; I graduated in 2023, after which I began a tenure-track position at Yale University. During my time at UVA, I was deeply involved with the digital humanities. I've worked on various projects and many subprojects within those projects, a sampling of which is available on this page: projects on which I was a research assistant (Collective Biographies of Women, For Better For Verse), projects on which I was a collaborator (the Wikipedia demographics research team), and projects which I started myself (the Direct Discourse Lab).</p> 
        <br><br>

        <p>These days, I'm mostly continuing to work on the Direct Discourse Lab while also attempting to bridge the gap between my interests in Indigenous literature and the digital humanities. Indigenous digital humanities is a burgeoning field. In the future, I hope to do work involving the intersections of decolonization and GIS mapping, or how methods of computational text analysis might be applied to Indigenous artworks that might resemble texts but are not exactly the same as Western texts (e.g. oral literature). I'm also interested in the ethics surrounding Indigenous DH. Please don't hesitate to get in touch if you'd like to collaborate now or anytime in the future!</p><br><br>
