                For Better For Verse

            <p>In the fall of 2017 I worked as a research assistant for Professor Chip Tucker's project <a href="https://prosody.lib.virginia.edu">For Better For Verse</a> (FBFV). The website is an interactive pedagogical tool that aims to teach students how to scan a poem (i.e. correctly apply stresses and slacks). Drawing on Professor Tucker's scans of dozens of poems, FBFV allows uers to mark a poem with stresses and slacks, along with delineations of metrical feet and, ultimately, the overall rhyme and meter scheme of the poem. They can then use various check features to see whether their "scanning" accords with Professor Tucker's. Various learners, from graduate students to secondary school students to independent scholars, have used the website to become better scanners.</p>
            <br><br>

            <p>I worked with Ammon Shepherd, a programmer in the Scholars' Lab, to clean up certain features of the website. I also created my own idea, a "broom" feature (seen below), which efficiently clears a user's progress on their scansion. Before implementing the broom capacity, users wanting to alter their scan of a poem had to wipe every stress/slack of a line individually: the broom let them do an entire line (usually  8-12 syllables long) in one fell swoop. By doing this, I brushed up on my technical skills, specifically <strong>JavaScript</strong>, which I had not coded in during my educaiton or work experience.</p>
             <br><br>
            <p>FBFV also offered me an opportunity to work in close conjunction with an extremely technically skilled person (Ammon Shepherd). As digital humanists, we need to be able to position our own understandings of the subject matter next to the expertise of people who fall more on the side of technical knowhow. While I had some coding skills myself, Ammon knew the landscape much better, and I learned while working in conjunction with him that digital humanities is <em>inherently collaborative</em>. This collaborative aspect of the field is a strength far more often that it is a hindrance, particularly when people with diverse skill sets work together.</p>
