                Wikipedia Research: Demographic Profiling
        </div>
        <img src="CBWHome.png" class="pic2">
            Since 2022 I have collaborated with PI <a href="https://datascience.virginia.edu/people/lane-rasberry">Lane Rasberry</a> at the UVA School of Data Science on various projects analyzing Wikipedia and Wikidata. Specifically, we have drafted a paper concerning the ethics of demographic profiling on the websites: how they categorize and list (potentially sensitive) information about human beings. We were supported by a Sloan Foundation grant. More recently, I have turned towards doing my own independent research on Wikipediaâ€”I'm currently working on a paper studying how "clarity" is pursued and achieved by Wiki editors.

            I worked with Lane to write up a project summary for Scholia for Software, a portion of the broader project called Scholia. The project aims to track, document, and make publicly available data on academic citations. The initiative that I helped write a report on specifically targeted increasing citational information for software, ensuring that software creators whose work was used in academic papers could be properly credited.

            In November 2022, Lane and I recorded an <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/wikiproject-biography/id1641538114?i=1000587000590">episode</a> of a podcast produced by the UVA School of Data Science. We discussed our work with the demographic profiling, but also our creation of a Data Model for the human being.
