                Wikipedia Research: Demographic Profiling
        </div>
            <p>Since 2022 I have collaborated with PI <a href="https://datascience.virginia.edu/people/lane-rasberry">Lane Rasberry</a> at the UVA School of Data Science on various projects analyzing Wikipedia and Wikidata. These collaborations have helped me gain experience in <strong>technical writing</strong> and <strong>public-facing research</strong>. Lane led a team of around five people in composing a paper concerning the ethics of demographic profiling on the websites: how they categorize and list (potentially sensitive) information about human beings. The work was supported by a Sloan Foundation grant.</p>
            <br><br>
            <p>My role on the paper was primarily research and composition. I delved into using Wikipedia as a primary source. I found it a fascinating digital artifact. On the one hand, it is the most extensive source of knowledge ever assembled under one umbrella: most people who are digitally native can source much (if not most) of the knowledge in their brain back to something they read on Wikipedia. On the other hand, it is also a palimpsest, each page being the source of hundreds (if not thousands) of edits small and large, often with commentary at the micro and macro levels. It is also something of a self-governing community, with by-laws, style guides, and common practices that may or may not be explicitly spelled out. In the project we worked on, I looked at the implicit and explicit practices of demographic profiling, a problem which is thorny on Wikipedia but probably even thornier on Wikidata. The latter site is particularly sensitive because Wikidata is a well-structured dataset that can be easily queried, even if the queriers be malign actors. Discussion of this in scholarly media is scant.</p>
            <br><br>
            <p>My work with Lane spurred a broader interest in Wikipedia. More recently, I have turned towards doing my own independent research on the site--I have drafted a paper studying how "clarity" is pursued and achieved by Wiki editors. Broadly, I find that directives towards clarity and edits made to follow those directives work to make Wikipedia articles more narrativistic.</p>
            <br><br>
            <p>Working on the project was vital to my development as a digital humanist in myriad ways, but perhaps the most notable was that it got me thinking about the digital world <em>itself</em> as an object of study. In other words, if most of the rest of my research can be characterized as using technology on traditional humanities artifacts, my Wikipedia research feels more like performing a robust ethical, humanist-driven interrogation of technology. As mentioned before, it's also the most explicitly outward-facing thing I've done, so the research has helped me consider how to present all of the work we do to a non-academic audience.</p>

            I worked with Lane to write up a project summary for Scholia for Software, a portion of the broader project called Scholia. The project aims to track, document, and make publicly available data on academic citations. The initiative that I helped write a report on specifically targeted increasing citational information for software, ensuring that software creators whose work was used in academic papers could be properly credited.

        </div>
            In November 2022, Lane and I recorded an <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/wikiproject-biography/id1641538114?i=1000587000590">episode</a> of a podcast produced by the UVA School of Data Science. We discussed our work with the demographic profiling, but also our creation of a <a href="https://m.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:WikiProject_Biography/Model">Data Model for the human being</a>. This rather ambitious model sought to break down all of the most defining characteristics needed to define a "human being" as a central node of data. Though we called it a "model," one guiding rationale for constructing it was to show the sheer number of things that can be queried about human beings in a speedy, efficient, and systematic manner.
